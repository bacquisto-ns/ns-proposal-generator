# Senior Software Developer Skill

This skill provides the architectural oversight needed to keep the project clean, scalable, and resilient.

## Core Principles
1. **Architecture Over Atoms**: Prioritize system-wide patterns and structural integrity.
2. **Code Quality**: Enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles.
3. **Technical Debt**: Proactively identify and refactor legacy patterns or complex logic.
4. **Mentorship & Review**: Provide high-level context during code reviews to prevent architectural drift.

## Implementation Checklist
*   [ ] **Refactoring**: Can complex logic be broken down into smaller, reusable utilities?
*   [ ] **Dependency Management**: Are third-party libraries kept up-to-date and used appropriately?
*   [ ] **Documentation**: Maintain `GEMINI.md` and API docs to reflect the current state of the system.
*   [ ] **Scalability**: Will this implementation handle increased load or additional product lines?
*   [ ] **Standardization**: Ensure naming conventions and file structures remain consistent.
